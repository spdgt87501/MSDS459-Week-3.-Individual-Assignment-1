Part 1 - Week 1 - Knowledge Graphs

Readings for week 1 from the Knowledge Graphs textbook included the first to chapters of the book.  The first chapter gave an overview of Euler Paths and Circuits, introduced Knowledge Graphs, and explained the relationship between the two.

According to Gupta (2024), the concept of a knowledge graph can be understood in five simple points.  First, a knowledge graph oganizes data by defining entiities in data by their relationships to other data.  Second, this is a unique approach as the data is now stored in a method where the structure itself defines the relationships between entities.  Third, this is diffferent from a traditional database as it removes the need to store the differnet entities and relationships on disparate tables forcing the need to manualy join them together.  Fourth, in a knowledge graph each entity is a node and the relationships could be drawn as lines connecting them.  Finally, this allows systems like AI to answer complex questions in a simpler way.

The article Euler and Hamiltonian Paths by GeeksforGeeks (2025) summarizes the concept of Euler Paths and Circuits in the following way.  Each defines a way through a knowledge graph where each connection or edge is utilized only once.  The Euler path will end at a place other than its start whereas a Euler Circutuit stops at the same node it started at.  A Euler path can be found in a knowledge graph if precisely none or two of its nodes have an odd number of conections to other nodes.  Whereas, a Euler Circuit can only exist if every node has an even number of connections.

The book's second chapter gives an overview of knowledge graph modeling methods.  In doing so it covers three concepts; the Resource Description Method (RDF), the RDF Schenma, and the Wikidata model.

An article by Loshin (2022) gives an excellect overview of RDF.
