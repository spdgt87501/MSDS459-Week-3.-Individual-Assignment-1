Part 1 - Week 1 - Knowledge Graphs

Readings for week 1 from the Knowledge Graphs textbook included two chapters.  The first chapter gave an overview of Euler's theorem, introduced Knowledge Graphs, and explained the relationship between the two.

According to Gupta (2024), the concept of a knowledge graph can be understood in five simple points.  First, a knowledge graph oganizes data by defining entiities in data by their relationships to other data.  Second, this is a unique approach as the data is now stored in a method where the structure itself defines the relationships between entities.  Third, this is diffferent from a traditional database as it removes the need to store the differnet entities and relationships on disparate tables forcing the need to manualy join them together.  Fourth, in a knowledge graph each entity is a node and the relationships could be drawn as lines connecting them.  Finally, this allows systems like AI to answer complex questions in a simpler way.
